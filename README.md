# Analyze A/B Test Results
## Description
This is the third project of the Data Analyst Nanodegree Program from Udacity. I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.

My goal is to work through the notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Files used
I will use the `ab_data.csv` and the `countries.csv` datasets to do my analysis. The datasets were provided by Udacity and can be downloaded [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/December/5a32c9db_analyzeabtestresults-2/analyzeabtestresults-2.zip).
